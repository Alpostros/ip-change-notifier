# IP Change Notifier

## Purpose
The whole purpose of this application is that: I do not have static IP assigned to me by my ISP, so whenever my IP changes, I cannot connect to my home network when I am outside. If my IP changes, I am notified with the new OpenVPN profile and my new IP address via email.

## Environment
Python Version: 3.9.2
OS: Raspberry Pi OS 64-bit
Device: A Raspberry Pi 4B with 4GB of RAM.
PiVPN should be installed and configured.
